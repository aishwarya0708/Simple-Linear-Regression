YouTube Engagement Analysis for "Galatta Tamil"
This project uses the YouTube Data API to analyze video data from the "Galatta Tamil" channel. It aims to predict video like counts using a linear regression model built with features like upload hour (IST), title/description length, thumbnail presence, and video duration. The project also identifies potentially optimal video upload times (in IST) for maximizing likes by analyzing historical engagement patterns across different upload hours. Key libraries used include googleapiclient, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. The findings offer insights into factors influencing video engagement and suggest data-driven strategies for content scheduling.
